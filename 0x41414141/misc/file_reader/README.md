# File Reader
We were given the challenge text:
```
hello guys, I started this new service check note.txt file for a sanity check 207.180.200.166 2324
```

Along with the file [reader.py](reader.py).

This was quite an easy challenge, and I got it on the first try which was a nice confidence boost for harder challenges. Since `/flag.txt` as banned, I tried `/f*` instead, which worked. The flag was `flag{oof_1t_g0t_expanded_93929}`.
